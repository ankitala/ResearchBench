Because of the favorable reactivity that often cannot be achieved with other aryl(pseudo)halides, diazonium chemistry continues to grow. Facile extrusion of dinitrogen contributes to the desired reactivity but is also reason for safety concerns. Explosions have occurred since the discovery of these reagents and still result in accidents. In this study, we report a diazonium chemistry paradigm shift based on nitrate reduction using thiosulfate or dihalocuprates as electron donors that avoids diazonium accumulation. Because nitrate reduction is rate-limiting, aryldiazoniums are produced as fleeting intermediates, which results in a safer and often more efficient deaminative halogenation in a single step from anilines."])

Originally, it was thought that an ion’s influence on macromolecular properties was caused at least in part by ‘making’ or ‘breaking’ bulk water structure. Recent timeresolved and thermodynamic studies of water molecules in salt solutions, however, demonstrate that bulk water structure is not central to the Hofmeister effect. Instead, models are being developed that depend upon direct ion–macromolecule interactions as well as interactions with water molecules in the first hydration shell of the macromolecule."]

Synthetic hydrogels have been created using methods such as electro-spinning2, extrusion3, compositing4,5, freeze-casting6,7, self-assembly8 and mechanical stretching9,10 for improved mechanical performance. However, in contrast to tendons, many hydrogels with the same high water content do not show high strength, toughness or fatigue resistance. Here we present a strategy to produce a multi-length-scale hierarchical hydrogel architecture using a freezing-assisted salting-out treatment. The produced poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels are highly anisotropic, comprising micrometre-scale honeycomb-like pore walls, which in turn comprise interconnected nanofibril meshes. These hydrogels have a water content of 70–95 per cent and properties that compare favourably to those of other tough hydrogels and even natural tendons; for example, an ultimate stress of 23.5 ± 2.7 megapascals, strain levels of 2,900 ± 450 per cent, toughness of 210 ± 13 megajoules per cubic metre, fracture energy of 170 ± 8 kilojoules per square metre and a fatigue threshold of 10.5 ± 1.3 kilojoules per square metre. The presented strategy is generalizable to other polymers, and could expand the applicability of structural hydrogels to conditions involving more demanding mechanical loading."]

The chaotropic effect becomes most effective for very large ions that extend beyond the classical Hofmeister scale and that can be referred to as superchaotropic ions (for example, borate clusters and polyoxometalates). In this Minireview, we present a continuous scale of water–solute interactions that includes the solvation of kosmotropic, chaotropic, and hydrophobic solutes, as well as the creation of void space (cavitation). Recent examples for the association of chaotropic anions to hydrophobic synthetic and biological binding sites, lipid bilayers, and surfaces are discussed."]

The relationship between the intrinsic physical parameters of the ion and the thermoelectric performance is established, indicating the ability to influence the hydrogen bond by the ion is a crucial factor. Among these i-TE hydrogels, the PVA/CsI hydrogel exhibits the largest ionic Seebeck coefficient, reaching 52.9 mV K–1, which is the largest of all i-TE materials reported to date. In addition, our work demonstrates the influence of ions on polymer configuration and provides an avenue for ion selection in the Soret effect in ionic thermoelectrics."]

We present a simple, inexpensive, and scalable phase inversion–based method for fabricating hierarchically porous poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) [P(VdF-HFP)HP] coatings with excellent PDRC capability. High, substrate-independent hemispherical solar reflectances (0.96 ± 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 ± 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of ~6°C and cooling powers of ~96 watts per square meter (W m−2) under solar intensities of 890 and 750 W m−2, respectively.

Though the I−/I3− redox couple has dominated in the last couple of decades, however, due to the loss of open-circuit potential, complementary absorption with a sensitizer and the volatile nature restricts the module development. Metal complexes with variable oxidation states are probable alternative candidates as redox shuttles due to the change in their redox potentials with varying ligands in order to suit different sensitizers. Co(III/II) redox couples using polypyridyl ligands have been widely used in DSSC and have crossed the device efficiency of 14%. However, mass transport constraints and health hazards exist due to the commercialization of technology. Inspired from biological electron transfer reactions, Cu(II/I) redox shuttles have gained much attention as redox couples for DSSC applications in recent years. Particularly in low light conditions, it minimizes mass transport, has a device efficiency greater than 32%, and has potential in Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

Distinct from existing batteries relying on periodic recharging, thermocells added with thermogalvanic ions are a promising candidate because they enable continuous electricity generation through redox reactions driven by ubiquitous waste heat. However, challenges remain in mechanical adaptability, fatigue resistance, and ion conduction, severely limiting thermocells’ sustainability and lifespan in practical applications. Herein, bionic mechanical training is applied to develop anti-fatigue and highly conductive thermocells with hierarchical fibrils and aligned nanochannels. It achieves simultaneous enhancements in mechanical performance and output power density. Compared with existing quasi-solid thermocells with disordered nano-networks, there are ≈1790-fold and 5-fold increases in the mechanical toughness and ionic conductivity, respectively. The stretchability can accommodate the human body's deformation, and the power density is comparable to that of state-of-the-art quasi-solid thermocells. Moreover, this is the first demonstration of an anti-fatigue thermocell with a threshold of 2500 J m−2, which is comparable to that of natural muscles and enables it to take full advantage of the continuous energy conversion mode."]

The thermogalvanic temperature coefficient {\alpha}, usually referred to as effective thermopower, is the key parameter determining the power density and efficiency of thermogalvanic batteries. However, the current understanding of improving {\alpha} of redox pairs remains at the phenomenological level without microscopic insights, and the development of electrolytes with high {\alpha} largely relies on experimental trial and error. This work applies the free energy perturbation method based on molecular dynamics simulations to predict the {\alpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair in aqueous and acetone solutions. We showed that {\alpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair can be increased from 1.5{\pm}0.3 mV/K to 4.1{\pm}0.4 mV/K with the increased acetone to water fraction. The predicted {\alpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} both in pure water and acetone show excellent agreement with experimental values. By monitoring the fluctuation of dipole orientations in the first solvation shell, we discovered a significant change in the variance of solvent dipole orientation between Fe^{3+} and Fe^{2+}, which can be a microscopic indicator for large magnitudes of {\alpha}. The effect of acetone weight fraction in the mixed acetone-water solvent on the {\alpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} is also studied. Acetone molecules are found to intercalate into the first solvation shell of the {Fe^{2+}} ion at high acetone fractions, while this phenomenon is not observed in the solvation shell of the Fe^{3+} ion. Such solvation shell structure change of {Fe^{2+}} ions contributes to the enhanced {\alpha} at high acetone fractions. Our discovery provides atomistic insights into how solvation shell order can be leveraged to develop electrolytes with high thermopower."]

For the cell to be attractive, however, the voltage generated for a given temperature difference has to be high. We report that the electrochemical thermopower can be more than doubled to 2.9 mV K−1 when an organic solvent with an appropriate solubility parameter is added to the aqueous electrolyte of ferri/ferrocyanide. This value is better than any reported for the redox couples in aqueous electrolyte as well as in organic solvents. The addition causes a significant rearrangement of the solvation shell, which leads to an increase in the entropy change of the overall redox system and thus an increase in the electrochemical thermopower. For an evaluation of thermoelectric conversion performance, a thermocell with a circulating electrolyte is fabricated as a candidate technology for harvesting thermal energy from liquid cooling systems. The maximum power density obtained, normalized to the square of the inter-electrode temperature difference (~4.1 °C), is 0.64 mW m−2K−2, which is approximately 1.8 times higher compared with the thermocell based on pure aqueous electrolyte."]

In this study, we synthesized polymers in which entanglements greatly outnumber cross-links. The dense entanglements enable transmission of tension in a polymer chain along its length and to many other chains. The sparse cross-links prevent the polymer chains from disentangling. These polymers have high toughness, strength, and fatigue resistance.

The scope of hydrogel applications, however, is often severely limited by their mechanical behaviour5. Most hydrogels do not exhibit high stretchability; for example, an alginate hydrogel ruptures when stretched to about 1.2 times its original length. Some synthetic elastic hydrogels6,7 have achieved stretches in the range 10–20, but these values are markedly reduced in samples containing notches. Most hydrogels are brittle, with fracture energies of about 10 J m−2 (ref. 8), as compared with ∼1,000 J m−2 for cartilage9 and ∼10,000 J m−2 for natural rubbers10. Intense efforts are devoted to synthesizing hydrogels with improved mechanical properties; certain synthetic gels have reached fracture energies of 100–1,000 J m−2. Here we report the synthesis of hydrogels from polymers forming ionically and covalently crosslinked networks. Although such gels contain ∼90% water, they can be stretched beyond 20 times their initial length, and have fracture energies of ∼9,000 J m−2. Even for samples containing notches, a stretch of 17 is demonstrated. We attribute the gels’ toughness to the synergy of two mechanisms: crack bridging by the network of covalent crosslinks, and hysteresis by unzipping the network of ionic crosslinks. Furthermore, the network of covalent crosslinks preserves the memory of the initial state, so that much of the large deformation is removed on unloading. The unzipped ionic crosslinks cause internal damage, which heals by re-zipping. These gels may serve as model systems to explore mechanisms of deformation and energy dissipation, and expand the scope of hydrogel applications."]

Our results showed how the structure and dynamics of the water near the GO surfaces changes under confinement conditions. Different orientations of the water molecules to the GO sheets confirm the heterogeneous nature of the confined water. The density distribution of water near the GO sheets is different from the graphene surfaces due to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups of the GO sheets. Also, the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules are disturbed due to the presence of these groups on the GO surfaces. The results showed that as water molecules in areas which are close to the GO surfaces are isolated, and due to hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and the substituents of the GO, the water molecules have fewer hydrogen bonds with other water molecules around. In the middle region between two GO sheets, it has been seen that each water molecule is surrounded by more water molecules, and there are many more hydrogen bonds, so it is possible to consider a network structure of water in this region. There is a good quantitative agreement between experiments and the above mentioned results. These results were confirmed by the calculated coordination number, radial distribution functions and mean square displacements."]

A 45-micrometer-thick Ti3C2Tx film exhibited EMI shielding effectiveness of 92 decibels (>50 decibels for a 2.5-micrometer film), which is the highest among synthetic materials of comparable thickness produced to date. This performance originates from the excellent electrical conductivity of Ti3C2Tx films (4600 Siemens per centimeter) and multiple internal reflections from Ti3C2Tx flakes in free-standing films. The mechanical flexibility and easy coating capability offered by MXenes and their composites enable them to shield surfaces of any shape while providing high EMI shielding efficiency."]

Notably, whereas hydrogels with a low content of PDA-EGaIn undergo rapid one-way bending under a single thermal (45 °C) stimulus, those with a high content of PDA-EGaIn undergo sequential bidirectional (bending) actuation. The ability of these hydrogels to undergo fast and tuneable actuation under a single thermal stimulus makes them suitable for use in grab-release instruments and soft robots."]

By a general and simple procedure involving mild reaction conditions and simple filtration to recover the labeled product, the isotopic labeling of 22 compounds proceeded in good yield with high chemo- and regioselectivity. The viability of this procedure was demonstrated by the labeling of eight biologically active compounds. Remarkably, enantiomeric purity was conserved in the labeled compounds, even though labeling took place in the vicinity of the stereogenic center. The level of isotopic enrichment observed is suitable for metabolomic studies in most cases. This approach is also perfectly adapted to tritium labeling because it uses a gas as an isotopic source.

Here we report cost-efficient and site-selective reductive deuteration using a tandem electrochemical chemical palladium membrane reactor. This architecture mediates the chemical reaction of deuterium atoms (derived from reusable D2O in an electrochemical compartment) with alkynes, aldehydes and imines. The formation of C(sp3)–D and C(sp2)–D bonds in the isolated chemical compartment is made possible by the deuterium-selective permeability of the membrane that partitions the electrochemical compartment from the chemical compartment.

Upon reduction of O2, the surface of Pt exhibits a compressive surface stress response, ΔStress, in both acid and base electrolytes due to adsorption of the ORR reactant and intermediates (O2, O, and OH). The magnitude of compressive ΔStress on Pt is greater in acid relative to base. On the other hand, the surface of Pd exhibits a negligible ΔStress in acid and a slight compressive ΔStress in base. Thus, magnitudes of the compressive ΔStress (surface expansion) during the ORR follow the order of Pt (acid) > Pt (base) > Pd (base) > Pd (acid) ∼ 0. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of adsorbate-induced excess surface stress on Pt(111) and Pd(111) surfaces imply a greater compressive surface stress induced on Pt(111) for nearly all adsorbate geometries examined. This trend, which agrees with the experimental observations, can be correlated to a greater tensile intrinsic surface stress of Pt(111) relative to Pd(111) resulting from difference in bond strength and bulk modulus of two metals. On stepped Pt(221) and Pd(221) surfaces, both the intrinsic tensile stress of the clean surface and the adsorbate-induced excess compressive stress are significantly reduced due to the presence of less coordinated, flexible step sites. Moreover, this difference between surface stress at terrace and step sites is more pronounced on Pt, which exhibits a greater intrinsic surface stress."]

Many anomalous properties of liquid water originate from its well-connected hydrogen bond network, including unusually efficient vibrational energy redistribution and relaxation. An accurate description of the ultrafast vibrational motion of water molecules is essential for understanding the nature of hydrogen bonds and many solution-phase chemical reactions. Most existing knowledge of vibrational relaxation in water is built upon ultrafast spectroscopy experiments. However, these experiments cannot directly resolve the motion of the atomic positions and require difficult translation of spectral dynamics into hydrogen bond dynamics. Here, we measure the ultrafast structural response to the excitation of the OH stretching vibration in liquid water with femtosecond temporal and atomic spatial resolution using liquid ultrafast electron scattering. We observed a transient hydrogen bond contraction of roughly 0.04 Å on a timescale of 80 femtoseconds, followed by a thermalization on a timescale of approximately 1 picosecond. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the need to treat the distribution of the shared proton in the hydrogen bond quantum mechanically to capture the structural dynamics on femtosecond timescales.

Chemoluminescent cross-linking molecules, which emit light as they break, map in real time where and when many of these internal bonds break ahead of a propagating crack. The simple methodology that we use to introduce sacrificial bonds, combined with the mapping of where bonds break, has the potential to stimulate the development of new classes of unfilled tough elastomers and better molecular models of the fracture of soft materials."]

In this study, a linear scan-based vat photopolymerization (LSVP) system which can print high-viscosity resins is implemented to 3D print the oligomer-dominated UV-curable resin via a dual-curing mechanism. A polyurethane methacrylate blocking oligomer is first synthesized and then mixed with a commercialized bifunctional oligomer, photoinitiator, and primary amine as a chain extender to prepare high-viscosity UV-curable resin for the LSVP system. The deblocked isocyanate is further crosslinked with a chain extender via thermal treatment to construct a highly entangled polymer chain network. The optimal thermal treatment parameters are investigated, and the resilience of the 3D-printed elastomer is evaluated through continuous tensile loading and unloading tests. Subsequently, complex structured elastomers are printed, exhibiting favorable mechanical durability without defects.

However, there are no established protocols to generalize the application of this technique in analytical chemistry. Here, a protocol for quantification at ultralow concentrations using SM-SERS is proposed. The approach aims to take advantage of the stochastic nature of the single-molecule regime to achieved lower limits of quantification (LOQ). Two emerging contaminants commonly found in aquatic environments, enrofloxacin (ENRO) and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), were chosen as nonresonant molecular probes. The methodology involves a multivariate resolution curve fitting known as non-negative matrix factorization with alternating least-squares algorithm (NMF-ALS) to solve spectral overlaps. The key element of the quantification is to realize that, under SM-SERS conditions, the Raman intensity generated by a molecule adsorbed on a “hotspot” can be digitalized. Therefore, the number of SERS event counts (rather than SERS intensities) was shown to be proportional to the solution concentration. This allowed the determination of both ENRO and CIPRO with high accuracy and precision even at ultralow concentrations regime. The LOQ for both ENRO and CIPRO were achieved at 2.8 pM.

Identification of PCET was an offshoot of experiments designed to investigate energy conversion by electron transfer quenching of molecular excited states. The concepts “redox potential leveling” and concerted electron–proton transfer came from measurements on stepwise oxidation of cis-RuII(bpy)2(py)(OH2)2+ to RuIV(bpy)2(py)(O)2+. The Ru “blue dimer”, cis,cis-(bpy)2(H2O)RuORu(OH2)(bpy)24+, was the first designed catalyst for water oxidation. It undergoes oxidative activation by PCET to give the transient (bpy)2(O)RuVORuV(O)(bpy)24+, O-atom attack on water to give a peroxidic intermediate, and further oxidation and O2 release. More recently, a class of single site water oxidation catalysts has been identified, e.g., Ru(tpy)(bpm)(OH2)2+ (tpy is 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine; bpm is 2,2′-bipyrimidine). They undergo stepwise PCET oxidation to RuIV=O2+ or RuV(O)3+ followed by O-atom transfer with formation of peroxidic intermediates which undergo further oxidation and O2 release. PCET plays a key role in the three zones of water oxidation reactivity: oxidative activation, O⋯O bond formation, oxidation and O2 release from peroxidic intermediates. Similar schemes have been identified for electrocatalytic water oxidation on oxide electrode surfaces based on phosphonated derivatives such as [Ru(Mebimpy)(4,4′-(PO3H2CH2)2bpy)(OH2)]2+. A PCET barrier to RuIII–OH2+ → RuIV=O2+ oxidation arises from the large difference in pKa values between RuIII–OH2+ and RuIV(OH)3+. On oxide surfaces this oxidation occurs by multiple pathways. Kinetic, mechanistic, and DFT results on single site catalysts reveal a new pathway for the O⋯O bond forming step (Atom-Proton Transfer, APT), significant rate enhancements by added proton acceptor bases, and accelerated water oxidation in propylene carbonate as solvent with water added as a stoichiometric reagent. Lessons learned about water oxidation and the role of PCET and concerted pathways appear to have direct relevance for water oxidation in Photosystem II (PSII) with PSII a spectacular example of PCET in action. This includes a key role for Multiple Site-Electron Proton Transfer in oxidative activation of the Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) in the S0 → S1 transition in the Kok cycle."]

Conventional techniques resulted in a mild improvement of target properties while degrading others. Here, a double-drawing technique is developed to rearrange the constituent CNTs. Consequently, the mechanical and thermal properties of the resulting CNTFs can simultaneously reach their highest performances with specific strength ~3.30 N tex−1 (4.60 GPa), work of rupture ~70 J g−1, and thermal conductivity ~354 W m−1 K−1 despite starting from low-crystallinity materials (IG:ID ~ 5).

Likewise, parameter optimization is omnipresent in artificial intelligence, from tuning virtual personal assistants to training social media and product recommendation systems2. Owing to the high cost associated with carrying out experiments, scientists in both areas set numerous (hyper)parameter values by evaluating only a small subset of the possible configurations. Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm, has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning models3. Bayesian optimization has also been recently applied in chemistry4,5,6,7,8,9; however, its application and assessment for reaction optimization in synthetic chemistry has not been investigated. Here we report the development of a framework for Bayesian reaction optimization and an open-source software tool that allows chemists to easily integrate state-of-the-art optimization algorithms into their everyday laboratory practices. We collect a large benchmark dataset for a palladium-catalysed direct arylation reaction, perform a systematic study of Bayesian optimization compared to human decision-making in reaction optimization, and apply Bayesian optimization to two real-world optimization efforts (Mitsunobu and deoxyfluorination reactions). Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data).

The high density of crosslinks that gives thermosets their useful properties (for example, chemical and thermal resistance and tensile strength) comes at the expense of degradability and recyclability. Here, using the industrial thermoset polydicyclopentadiene as a model system, we show that when a small number of cleavable bonds are selectively installed within the strands of thermosets using a comonomer additive in otherwise traditional curing workflows, the resulting materials can display the same mechanical properties as the native material, but they can undergo triggered, mild degradation to yield soluble, recyclable products of controlled size and functionality. By contrast, installation of cleavable crosslinks, even at much higher loadings, does not produce degradable materials. These findings reveal that optimization of the cleavable bond location can be used as a design principle to achieve controlled thermoset degradation.

To enable the circularity of FRPs, we formulated a bio-derivable polyester covalently adaptable network (PECAN), sometimes referred to as a polyester vitrimer, to manufacture FRPs at >1 kg scale, which is accomplished as the resin is infusible (175–425 cP at 25°C viscosity), can be cured at 80°C within 5 h and is depolymerizable via methanolysis yielding high-quality fibers and recoverable hardener. The FRPs exhibit a transverse tensile modulus comparable with today’s wind relevant FRPs (10.4–11.9 GPa). Modeling estimates a resin minimum selling price of $2.28/kg and, relative to an epoxy-amine resin, PECAN manufacture requires 19%–21% less supply chain energy and emits 33%–35% less greenhouse gas emissions.

Implicit in the supramolecular description of a crystal structure is the fact that molecules in a crystal are held together by noncovalent interactions. The need for rational approaches towards solid-state structures of fundamental and practical importance has led to the emergence of crystal engineering, which seeks to understand intermolecular interactions and recognition phenomena in the context of crystal packing. The aim of crystal engineering is to establish reliable connections between molecular and supramolecular structure on the basis of intermolecular interactions. Ideally one would like to identify substructural units in a target supermolecule that can be assembled from logically chosen precursor molecules. Indeed, crystal engineering is a new organic synthesis, and the aim of this article is to show that rather than being only nominally relevant to organic chemistry, this subject is well within the mainstream, being surprisingly similar to traditional organic synthesis in concept. The details vary because one is dealing here with intermolecular interactions rather than with covalent bonds; so this article is divided into two parts.

Due attention was given to the interplay between the polymer and perovskite absorber, both within the framework of a bilayer structure and fully assembled solar cells. The obtained results imply that UV degradation exerts a major influence on the structural integrity of PTAA, rather than on the interface with the perovskite light harvester.

The latter include nanostructured electrodes (Chapter 1), electrodes based on carbon nanotubes (Chapter 3), and surface-attached electroactive nanoparticles (Chapter 4). There is a degree of thematic overlap between Chapters 1 and 3. \nThe range of topics presented in the book is impressive. It includes the interfacing of electrodes with proteins, electrical communication through molecular wires, electrode surfaces with switchable properties, advanced surface patterning, theory and practice of redox polyelectrolyte films, structure and properties of carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube-based electrodes, faradaic electroactivity of nanoparticles, electrodeposition of metal on self-assembled monolayers, layer-by-layer assembly, amperometric biosensors, immunosensors, DNA sensors, electrochromic devices, electrochemical actuators, and energy-harvesting devices. The latest developments in these areas are nicely presented in the context of older literature. The references are generally thorough—although, perhaps unavoidably, there are some noticeable omissions as mentioned below—and cover the literature up to 2008. The book keeps a satisfying balance between analytical and physical chemistry aspects of the modified electrodes. \nIn addition to the exciting topics covered in this book, there have also been other important developments in this field recently that are not covered here, such as advances in electrodeposition of inorganic films for detection of biomolecules, chitosan-enzyme-based biosensors, molecularly imprinted film electrodes, and multicomponent modified electrodes that display synergistic analytical effects. The reader should also be advised to exercise a degree of caution when reading some of the literature reports on the direct interfacing of electrodes with enzymes. In particular, the claims that the direct electron transfer between the unoriented mats of carbon nanotubes and glucose oxidase provides the basis for mediatorless detection of glucose are not sufficiently supported by relevant control experiments. After all, no commercial modified electrodes have been developed for the mediatorless enzymatic determination of glucose thus far, despite considerable efforts."]

The nature of the X-E bonding has been analyzed with charge- and energy-partitioning methods. The calculations show that the linear isomers of the nitrogen systems lin-HEN and lin-HNE are minima on the singlet PES. The carbon compound lin-HCN (HCN=hydrogen cyanide) is 14.9 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than lin-HNC but the heavier group 14 homologues lin-HEN (E=Si-Pb) are between 64.8 and 71.5 kcal mol(-1) less stable than the lin-HNE isomers. The phosphorous system (H, P, E) exhibits significant differences concerning the geometry and stability of the equilibrium structures compared with the nitrogen system. The linear form lin-HEP of the former system is much more stable than lin-HPE. The molecule lin-HCP is the only minimum on the singlet PES.

The drastic energy differences between the isomers of the system (H, X, E) are explained with three factors that determine the relative stabilities of the energy minima: 1) The different bond strength between the hydrogen bonds H-X and H-E. 2) The electronic excitation energy of the fragment HE from the X (2)Π ground state to the (4)Σ(-) excited state, which is required to establish a E≡X triple bond in the molecules lin-HEX. 3) The strength of the intrinsic X-E interactions in the molecules.

Known homogeneous CDA systems often require the use of sacrificial hydrogen acceptors (or oxidants), precious metal catalysts, and harsh reaction conditions, thus limiting most existing methods to dehydrogenation of non- or low-functionalized alkanes. Here we describe a visible-light-driven, dual-catalyst system consisting of inexpensive organophotoredox and base-metal catalysts for room-temperature, acceptorless-CDA (Al-CDA). Initiated by photoexited 2-chloroanthraquinone, the process involves H atom transfer (HAT) of aliphatics to form alkyl radicals, which then react with cobaloxime to produce olefins and H2. This operationally simple method enables direct dehydrogenation of readily available chemical feedstocks to diversely functionalized olefins. For example, we demonstrate, for the first time, the oxidant-free desaturation of thioethers and amides to alkenyl sulfides and enamides, respectively. Moreover, the system’s exceptional site selectivity and functional group tolerance are illustrated by late-stage dehydrogenation and synthesis of 14 biologically relevant molecules and pharmaceutical ingredients.

After surveying twenty-two phosphorus ligands, high yields of products were obtained with aryl chlorides only when a bulky ligand, 2-(di-tert-butyl-phosphino)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrrole (cataCXium®PtB) was used. In contrast, aryl bromides produced high yields of products in the absence of both added base and added ligand. In order to explore the Suzuki coupling process entirely under acidic conditions, a series of reactions were conducted in buffered acidic media using several model substrates. 4-Chlorobenzylamine, in the presence of cataCXium®PtB, produced high yields of product at buffered pH 6.0; the yields dropped off precipitously at buffered pH 5.0 and lower.

This reaction is generally achieved with transition metals (TMs) through interception by carbon sources of an alkylmetal [β-H–C(sp3)–[M]] species, a key intermediate prone to undergo rapid β-H elimination. Related prior reports, since Paolo Chiusoli and Catellani’s work in 1982 [ Tetrahedron Lett. 1982, 23, 4517], have used bicyclic and disubstituted terminal alkenes, wherein β-H elimination is avoided by geometric restriction or complete lack of β-H’s. With reasoning that β-H–C(sp3)–[M] intermediates could be rendered amenable to interception with the use of first row late TMs and formation of coordination-assisted transient metallacycles, these two strategies were implemented to address the β-H elimination problem in alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions.\nBecause first row late TMs catalyze C(sp3)–C(sp3) coupling, Cu and Ni were anticipated to impart sufficient stability to β-H–C(sp3)–[M] intermediates, generated catalytically upon alkene carbometalation, for their subsequent interception by carbon electrophiles/nucleophiles in three-component reactions. Additionally, such an innate property could enable alkene difunctionalization with carbon coupling partners through entropically driven cyclization/coupling reactions. The cyclometalation concept to stabilize intractable β-H–C(sp3)–[M] intermediates was hypothesized when three-component reactions were performed. The idea of cyclometalation to curtail β-H elimination is founded upon Whitesides’s [ J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976, 98, 6521] observation that metallacycles undergo β-H elimination much slower than acyclic alkylmetals.\nIn this Account, examples of alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions demonstrate that Cu and Ni catalysts could enable cyclization/coupling of alkenylzinc reagents, alkyl halides, and aryl halides to afford complex carbo- and heterocycles. In addition, forming coordination-assisted transient nickellacycles enabled regioselective performance of three-component dicarbofunctionalization of various alkenyl compounds. In situ reaction of [M]-H with alkenes generated after β-H elimination induced an unprecedented metallacycle contraction process, in which six-membered metal-containing rings shrank to five-membered cycles, allowing creation of new carbon–carbon bonds at allylic (1,3) positions. Applications of these regioselective alkene dicarbofunctionalization reactions are discussed."]

Calculations suggest the reaction mechanism proceeds via the slippage of π-bound alkyne at the Rh centre into a Rh–alkyne σC–H complex followed by an indirect 1,2-H shift to give the Rh–vinylidene species. NBO (Natural Bond Orbital) analysis of the transition states corresponding to the latter indirect 1,2-H shift step indicates that the migrating hydrogen atom exhibits protic character and hence, the basicity of the H-accepting centre (Cβ) is controlled by the substituents at that same atom and can tune the 1,2-H shift transition state. QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecule) and NBO analyses of the Rh–vinylidene complexes indicate that these species exhibit a Rh ← C dative bond as well as π-back bonding from the Rh centre into the empty pz orbital of the carbene centre (Cα), showing the Rh–vinylidene complexes are Fischer type carbenes. Analysis of the alkyne and vinylidene complex HOMOs show that the equilibrium between the isomers can be tuned by the P–Rh–P bite angle of the [Rh(pincer)]+ fragment.

We found that rhodium-carbynoid species provoke C(sp2)–C(sp2) bond scission in alkenes by inserting a monovalent carbon unit between both sp2-hybridized carbons. This skeletal remodeling process accesses synthetically useful allyl cation intermediates that conduct to valuable allylic building blocks upon nucleophile attack. Our results rely on the formation of cyclopropyl-I(III) intermediates able to undergo electrocyclic ring-opening, following the Woodward–Hoffmann–DePuy rules."]

Net-neutral RPC is particularly interesting in that both the single-electron oxidation and reduction steps occur through interaction with the photocatalyst, thus precluding the need for exogenous oxidants or reductants. As such, these transformations facilitate rapid incorporation of molecular complexity while maintaining mild reaction conditions. This review covers recent advances in photoredox-mediated net-neutral RPC synthetic methods, with a particular emphasis on C–C bond-forming reactions."]
        groundtruth_inspiration_bkg48_insp1 = ["Catalytic enantioconvergent coupling of secondary and tertiary electrophiles with olefins", "Carbon–carbon bonds, including those between sp3-hybridized carbon atoms (alkyl–alkyl bonds), typically comprise much of the framework of organic molecules. In the case of sp3-hybridized carbon, the carbon can be stereogenic and the particular stereochemistry can have implications for structure and function1,2,3. As a consequence, the development of methods that simultaneously construct alkyl–alkyl bonds and control stereochemistry is important, although challenging. Here we describe a strategy for enantioselective alkyl–alkyl bond formation, in which a racemic alkyl electrophile is coupled with an olefin in the presence of a hydrosilane, rather than via a traditional electrophile–nucleophile cross-coupling, through the action of a chiral nickel catalyst. We demonstrate that families of racemic alkyl halides—including secondary and tertiary electrophiles, which have not previously been shown to be suitable for enantioconvergent coupling with alkyl metal nucleophiles—cross-couple with olefins with good enantioselectivity and yield under very mild reaction conditions. Given the ready availability of olefins, our approach opens the door to developing more general methods for enantioconvergent alkyl–alkyl coupling."]
        groundtruth_inspiration_bkg48_insp2 = ["Nickel-catalysed hydrodimerization of unactivated terminal alkenes", "Site-selective homo- and cross-hydrodimerization of terminal alkenes has remained a long-standing challenge in organic synthesis. Metal-hydride-catalysed selective dimerization, oligomerization or polymerization methods are often limited to electronically biased or small alkene substrates. Here we report the development of a nickel-catalysed protocol that enables selective homo- and cross-dimerization of unactivated linear and sterically congested terminal alkenes to afford linear alkyl‒alkyl products in good yields and high linear/branched selectivity. The process is tolerant of a range of functionalities including heteroatoms, saturated heterocycles and bioactive motifs. Mechanistic experiments reveal that the co-oxidants we used, CuBr2 and di-tert-butyl peroxide, probably convert dialkyl‒Ni(II) intermediates to the corresponding Ni(III) species through a single-electron-transfer process. This oxidative step avoids decomposition of thermally labile dialkyl‒Ni(II) intermediates and promotes the formation of hydrodimerization products by reductive elimination of the Ni(III) complex. Without CuBr2, high branched selectivity was achieved, affording the methyl-branched products—which are typically difficult to synthesize—in good yields."]

Mechanistic investigations on this unprecedented transformation have uncovered the possibility of an unexpected mechanism hypothesized to involve a Ni–Br homolysis event from an excited-state nickel complex. The resultant bromine radical is thought to abstract weak C(sp3)–H bonds to generate reactive alkyl radicals that can be engaged in Ni-catalyzed arylation. Evidence suggests that the iridium photocatalyst facilitates nickel excitation and bromine radical generation via triplet–triplet energy transfer."]

Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop efficient strategies to rapidly construct structurally distinct and diverse “privileged” molecular scaffolds, thereby giving rise to compound libraries with selective and differing biological activities. This review covers recent efforts in this emerging field of Ni-catalyzed divergent and selective synthesis, and will focus on reactions using the same substrate to generate structurally diverse molecular scaffolds by varying the ligand backbone under otherwise almost identical reaction conditions. We hope that the field will be encouraged by the progress achieved, drawing attention to the design and development of new selective catalytic systems, and revealing new modes of catalytic transformation for broader synthetic applications."]

For arene functionalization, metallophotoredox catalysis has successfully made use of the same leaving groups as those valuable in conventional cross-coupling catalysis, such as bromide. Yet the redox potentials of common photoredox catalysts are not sufficient to reduce most aryl bromides, so synthetically useful aryl radicals are often not directly available. Therefore, the development of a distinct leaving group more appropriately matched in redox potential could enable new reactivity manifolds for metallophotoredox catalysis, especially if arylcopper(III) complexes are accessible, from which the most challenging bond-forming reactions can occur. Here we show the conceptual advantages of aryl thianthrenium salts for metallophotoredox catalysis, and their utility in site-selective late-stage aromatic fluorination."]
        groundtruth_inspiration_bkg50_insp2 = ["Site-selective and versatile aromatic C−H functionalization by thianthrenation", "Direct C–H functionalization can quickly increase useful structural and functional molecular complexity1,2,3. Site selectivity can sometimes be achieved through appropriate directing groups or substitution patterns1,2,3,4—in the absence of such functionality, most aromatic C–H functionalization reactions provide more than one product isomer for most substrates1,4,5. Development of a C–H functionalization reaction that proceeds with high positional selectivity and installs a functional group that can serve as a synthetic linchpin for further functionalization would provide access to a large variety of well-defined arene derivatives. Here we report a highly selective aromatic C–H functionalization reaction that does not require a particular directing group or substitution pattern to achieve selectivity, and provides functionalized arenes that can participate in various transformations. We introduce a persistent sulfur-based radical to functionalize complex arenes with high selectivity and obtain thianthrenium salts that are ready to engage in different transformations, via both transition-metal and photoredox catalysis. This transformation differs fundamentally from all previous aromatic C–H functionalization reactions in that it provides direct access to a large number of derivatives of complex small molecules, quickly generating functional diversity with selectivity that is not achievable by other methods."]
