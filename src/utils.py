        prompts = ["You are helping with the scientific hypotheses generation process. We in general split the period of research hypothesis proposal into three steps. Firstly it's about finding a good and specific background research question, and an introduction of the previous methods under the same topic; Secondly its about finding inspirations (mostly from literatures), which combined with the background research question, can lead to an impactful research hypothesis; Finally it's hypothesis generation based on the background research question and found inspirations. Usually a paper can be choosed as an inspiration is because it can potentially help to solve or alleviate one problem of a previous method for this research question so that leveraging the concepts related to the inspiration, a better method can be developed based on the previous methods and this inspiration. Take backpropagation as an example, the research question is how to use data to automatically improve the parameters of a multi-layer logistic regression with data, the inspiration is the chain rule in mathematics, and the research hypothesis is the backpropagation itself. Here the previous method can only inference the multi-layer logistic regression, but can't automatically update its parameters to learn from data. The selected chain rule inspiration can be leveraged to automatically update the parameters in the multi-layer logistic regression, and therefore improve over the previous method to create hypothesis. \nGiven a research question, the background and some of the existing methods for this research question, and several top-tier publications (including their title and abstract), try to identify which publication can potentially serve as an inspiration for the background research question so that combining the research question and the inspiration in some way, a novel, valid, and significant research hypothesis can be formed.

All four aspects should be evaluated in a 5 point scale." + "\nAspect 1: Validness. \n5 points: The hypothesis is a logical next step from current research, strongly supported by theory, perhaps with some indirect experimental evidence or highly predictive computational results. The experimental verification seems straightforward with a high probability of confirming the hypothesis; 4 points: Here, the hypothesis is well-rooted in existing theory with some preliminary data or computational models supporting it. It extends known science into new but logically consistent areas, where experiments are feasible with current technology, and there's a reasonable expectation of positive results; 3 points: This hypothesis is within the realm of theoretical possibility but stretches the boundaries of what's known. It might combine existing knowledge in very novel ways or predict outcomes for which there's no direct evidence yet. There's a conceptual framework for testing, but success is uncertain; 2 points: While the hypothesis might be grounded in some theoretical aspects, it significantly deviates from current understanding or requires conditions or materials that are currently impossible or highly improbable to achieve or synthesize; 1 point: The hypothesis proposes concepts or outcomes that are not only unsupported by current theory but also contradict well-established principles or data. There's no clear path to experimental testing due to fundamental theoretical or practical barriers. " + "\nAspect 2: Novelty. \n5 points: This level of novelty could fundamentally alter our understanding of chemistry or create entirely new fields. It often involves predictions or discoveries that, if proven, would require a significant overhaul of existing chemical theories; 4 points: The hypothesis significantly departs from established norms, potentially redefining how certain chemical phenomena are understood or applied. It might involve entirely new materials or theoretical frameworks; 3 points: This level involves a hypothesis that could potentially lead to new insights or applications. It might challenge minor aspects of current theories or introduce new methodologies or materials; 2 points: The hypothesis introduces a new angle or method within an established framework. It might involve known compounds or reactions but in contexts or combinations not previously explored; 1 point: The hypothesis involves minor tweaks or applications of well-known principles or techniques. It might slightly extend existing knowledge but doesn't introduce fundamentally new concepts. " + "\nAspect 3: Significance. \n5 points: This hypothesis could fundamentally change one or more branches of chemistry. It might introduce entirely new principles, theories, or methodologies that redefine the boundaries of chemical science; 4 points: This hypothesis challenges current understanding or introduces a concept that could lead to substantial changes in how a particular area of chemistry is viewed or applied. It might lead to new technologies or significant theoretical advancements; 3 points: this hypothesis proposes something new or an innovative approach that could lead to noticeable advancements in a specific area of chemistry. It might open new avenues for research or application but doesn't revolutionize the field; 2 points: This hypothesis might offer a small variation or incremental improvement on existing knowledge. It could potentially refine a known concept but doesn't significantly alter the field; 1 point: The hypothesis addresses a very narrow or already well-established aspect of chemistry. It might confirm what is already known without adding much new insight." + "\nAspect 4: Potential. \n5 points: The hypothesis, while potentially intriguing now, holds the promise of being revolutionary with the addition of a key methodological component. This could introduce entirely new concepts or fields, fundamentally changing our understanding or capabilities in chemistry; 4 points: The hypothesis, though promising, could be transformative with the right methodological enhancement. This enhancement might lead to groundbreaking discoveries or applications, significantly advancing the field; 3 points: The hypothesis, while interesting in its current form, could be significantly elevated with the right methodological addition. This might lead to new insights or applications that go beyond the initial scope; 2 points: The hypothesis currently offers some value but has the potential for more substantial contributions if enhanced with a new methodological approach. This could lead to incremental advancements in understanding or application; 1 point: The hypothesis, as it stands, might be straightforward or well-trodden.
